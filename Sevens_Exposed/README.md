    "Ana and graham of the two and five
    ana and graham are the will to survive
    ana and graham will run down the kills
    ana and graham live in the hard drives
    as they approach the end of the cliff,
    they take a bow and leap from the edge
    only the sky, by the moon is lit,
    will bear witness to their final pledge.
    ana and graham by there tangled web,
    entwined by the lives that their souls hath need. 
    the spiders come out and weave up the dead,
    god can look down and mourn while he weeps.
    ana and graham and all they opposed,
    shall fall silent as they decompose
    the cicadas will sing as so it is composed
    and the cicadas shall ensure the sevens exopsed."

    "ana and graham expose the sevens and opposed the heavens
    ana and graham revealed the omega and concealed the stego
    ana and graham knew their demise before the apprise
    ana and graham told the cicada to reveal the sevens without
    asking questions.
    because when the devil curses our revel
    then sevens split, as luck would have it\
