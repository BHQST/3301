**Pi Mobi** was the last puzzle that used **PGP** elements in it.

**Pi Mobi** was created before Z3301 aka richard todd miller's involvement with puzzle creation.

- Are we paying attention yet? The main twitter on jan 05 2016 made this post. Pay attention to the time frame for proof of pi.mobi being 3301. (https://x.com/1231507051321/status/684596461628223488?s=19)

  - There was an outguess signed pgp message embedded into 4gq25.jpg. You can find the message in Solves under [`Solves`](https://github/BHQST/3301/Solves/4gq25.jpg_outguess.txt)

  - For the people that don't know how to install the old outguess, you can use (https://www.aperisolve.com) which seems to still work on old outguess files. the newer version of outguess will not work on outguess files made with older version.

  - There was also some text in the source.
    - ἔνδον τοῦ πύργου, οὗ ὁ ἄνεμος ἐπιβουλεύει σὺν τὰ *****τοῦ/τῆϛ***** Çelebi πτερὰ, κεῖται πλίνθος ἣ ἐνέπει μῦθον, εὖτε ἡ θεωρία διαμένει. Ζητοὺ καὶ εὑρίσκου.
      - It is Greek. "Inside the tower, where the wind whispers with the wings of Çelebi, lies a brick that embodies myth, or theory resides. Seek and you will find."

Stirs and turns and time once more is green,
In empty path and lane and grass will creep

  - (http://31415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751.mobi/test.txt) This was a test that you emailed the answers to the test to an email below.

1. You're a treasure hunter and, along with your 9 companions, you just discovered  a buried chest with 100 silver coins inside. Amongst your crew there is a strict hierarchy (with you being the most important one) and there are no two equally important  people. You and your companions decided that you are going to propose the  way of distributing the treasure using aforementioned hierarchy. When someone makes his proposal , all of the treasure hunters ( including the proposing one) are voting whether  to accept it or decline it. If at least half of the treasure hunters  vote  "for" , the proposal is accepted and the treasure distributed but if the majority votes "against", the one ,who made the proposal , is killed off and the next one in the hierarchy has the right to make a proposal. The voting order is the same as the proposing order. The goal of each and everyone of the treasure hunters ( you included)  is to gain the highest amount of silver coins possible and survive. Every treasure hunter is equally as smart as the rest and votes in a way allowing him to achieve that goal but if said treasure hunter was to gain 0 silver coins , then he always votes "against".   You , as the most important one , make the first proposal.
What way of distributing are you going to propose to achieve the goal?
Substantiate your answer.
 
2. Prove that  φ(n) = (ρ - 1) (q - 1)  when N = ρq  and  both ρ and q are primes.
 
3. Zlsf auvmf qry , qai?
 
4. A master proposes a game to a man. He says " I have two envelopes. White and black. The white envelope contains a key to a box with 1000 golden coins. The black envelope contains either a key to a box with 1 000 000 golden coins or it contains nothing.  You have two choices : you can either take the black envelope only or you can take both of them.
The black envelope was filled many years ago by a Divinity. The Divinity can see the future. The Divinity is never wrong.  The Divinity has done this :
- If it predicted that you would take the black envelope, it  put the key to the box with 1 000 000 coins into the black envelope
- If it predicted that you would take both envelopes , it put nothing into the black envelope
The Divinity can see the future. The Divinity is never wrong.
a)  what would be your choice? Is it a difficult one to make?
b)  what possible question does this game illustrate?
Substantiate your answers.

6. You are the only one who survived of a sunken ship. You managed to make a provisory raft and you are drifting alongside the island coast. You know that this particular island is inhabited by two tribes. The ones that call themselves "Owls" and the ones that call themselves "Crows". The Owls are a kind and peaceful tribe and they always tell the truth. The Crows , on the other hand , are deceptive ,  malevolent and always lie.  You seek shelter amid the Owls. When you see one of the tribesmen standing near the shore , you shout to him "Are you an Owl or a Crow?" . The tribesman answers the question but it's drown out by the sound of the waves and you are unable to hear the response.  Your raft is drifting farther down when you encounter the second tribesman. You ask him an identical question to which he replies "I am an Owl" , he then points his finger at the first tribesman that you passed and says "he said he was an Owl". You keep on drifting and you encounter the third tribesman. You ask him the same question to which he replies in a friendly manner "I am an Owl. They are Crows. They both are liars".
Given the information provided :
a) can you establish any man's afilliation?
b) can you establish each man's affiliation?
c) which one of the tribesmen would be your safest option?
Substantiate your answers.
